\Question{Modular Practice}

Solve the following modular arithmetic equations for $x$ and $y$.
\begin{Parts}
\Part $9x+5 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$.

\begin{solution} 
  We can rearrange this to be $9x \equiv -2 \pmod{11}$, which can then be written as $9x \equiv -9 \pmod{11}$ so this implies that $x = -1$. And further, since we can add multiples of 11 withotu issue (since any multiple of 11 is divisible by 11), then we have the general solution for $x$: $\forall n \in \mathbb Z, \  x = -1 + 11n$
\end{solution}

\Part Show that $3x+15 \equiv 4 \pmod{21}$ does not have a solution.

\begin{solution}
  This is equivalent to writing $3x \equiv -11 \pmod{21}$ or $3x \equiv 10 \pmod{21}$. To show that this has no solution, we analyze the possible residues of multiples of 3 modulo 21. Any multiple of 3 can only be $3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18$ modulo 21 (since they're multiples of 3). Since 10 is not on this list, this equation has no solution.
\end{solution}

\Part The system of simultaneous equations
$3x+2y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ and $2x+y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$.

\begin{solution}
  We can solve this system of equations in the same way we solve any system of equations: multiply the latter equation by 2 to get $4x + 2y \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$

  \[ 3x + 2y - (4x + 2y) \equiv -1 \pmod{7}\] 

  From here we get that $-x \equiv 1 \pmod 7 \implies x = 1 + 7n$ for all $n \in \mathbb Z$. Now we can solve for $y$, by letting $x =1$ for simplicity: 

  \begin{align*}
    3 + 2y &\equiv 0 \pmod{12}\\
    2y &\equiv 5 \pmod 7\\
    \therefore y &\equiv 2 \pmod {7}
  \end{align*}

  This implies the solutions $y = 2 + 7n$ for all $n \in \mathbb Z$. Thus, our solutions for $x$ and $y$ are in the form $x = 1 + 7n$ and $y = 2 + 7k$ for all $k, n \in \mathbb Z$.
\end{solution}

\Part $13^{2019} \equiv x \pmod{12}$.


\begin{solution}
  Notice that $13 \equiv 1 \pmod {12}$ and so our equation becomes $1^{2019} \pmod {12}$ so therefore the result is 1.
\end{solution}
\Part $7^{21} \equiv x \pmod{11}$.

\begin{solution}
  We can rewrite $7^{21} = \left(7^{3}\right)^7$ and since $7^3 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, which is easily computable. This means that 

  \[ 128 \equiv 2 \pmod {11}\]

  And since 121 is a power of 11, then the remainder would be $7$, which is our answer.
\end{solution}

\Question{Nontrivial Modular Solutions}

\begin{Parts}

\Part What are all the possible perfect cubes modulo 7?

\begin{solution}
  Every perfect cube can be decomposed into $0, 1^3, 2^3, \dots, 6^3$ when taken modulo 7. Thus, we can construct a chart: 

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
      $x$ & $x^3 \pmod{7}$ \\ \hline
      0   & 0              \\
      1   & 1              \\
      2   & 1              \\
      3   & -1             \\
      4   & 1              \\
      5   & -1             \\
      6   & -1            
      \end{tabular}
  \end{center}


\end{solution}
\Part Show that any solution to $a^3 + 2b^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ must satisfy $a \equiv b \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.


\begin{solution}
  We use the previous part, as well as the additive property of modular arithmetic, except in reverse: if $a^3 \equiv c \pmod 7$ then $2b^3 \equiv -c \pmod 7$, so that the net sum on the right hand side remains zero. Now let's look at the latter equation. Since we've shown that all nonzero numbers are $\pm 1$ modulo 7, this implies that

  \[ 2b^3 \equiv \pm -1 \pmod 7\] 

  But since $b^3 \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 7$, this means that $2b^3 \equiv \pm 2 \pmod 7$, implying that there is no nonzero solution to $2b^3 \pm -1 \pmod 7$ for nonzero $c$. Thus, the only solution arises when $c = 0$, which would imply that $a^3 \equiv 0 \pmod 7$ and $2b^3 \equiv 0 \pmod 7$, with each equation implying that $a \equiv 0 \pmod 7$ and $b \equiv 0 \pmod 7$, respectively.
\end{solution}

\Part Using part (b), prove that $a^3 + 2b^3 = 7a^2b$ has no non-trivial solutions $(a, b)$ in the integers. In other words, there are no integers $a$ and $b$, that satisfy this equation, except the trivial solution $a=b=0$.

[\emph{Hint:} Consider some nontrivial solution $(a, b)$ with the smallest value for $\abs{a}$ (why are we allowed to consider this?). Then arrive at a contradiction by finding another solution $(a', b')$ with $\abs{a'} < \abs{a}$.]

\begin{solution}
  We use the hint. Suppose there is a smallest nontrivial solution $(a, b)$ with the smallest value of $\abs{a}$ that satisfies this equation. We know from the previous part that $a \equiv b \equiv 0 \pmod 7$, so thus we can write $a = 7k$ and $b = 7m$ for some $k, m \in \mathbb Z$. So we can rewrite the above equation: 

  \begin{align*}
    (7k)^3 + 2(7m)^3 &= 7(7k^2)(7m)\\
    7^3 k^3 + 2 \cdot 7^3m^3 &= 7^4k^2m\\
    \therefore k^3 + 2m^3 &= 7k^2m
  \end{align*}

  But this last equation seemingly suggests that $(k, m)$ is also a valid solution. And since $a = 7k \implies |k| = |a/7| < |a|$ then this means that this solution pair is smaller than our original $(a, b)$. This is a contradiction, since we assumed earlier that $(a, b)$ was the nontrivial pair with the smallest $|a|$. As a result, this solution has no nontrivial solutions $(a, b)$. 

  It's also easy to show that the trivial solution $(a, b) = (0, 0)$ is valid since both the left and right hand sides equal zero.
\end{solution}

\Question{Wilson's Theorem}

Wilson's Theorem states the following is true if and only if $p$ is prime:
    \[(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.\]
Prove both directions (it holds if AND only if $p$ is prime).

Hint for the if direction: Consider rearranging the terms in $(p - 1)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot (p - 1)$ to pair up terms with their inverses, when possible. What terms are left unpaired?

Hint for the only if direction: If $p$ is composite, then it has some prime factor $q$.  What can we say about $(p-1)! \pmod{q}$?

\Question{Fermat's Little Theorem}

Without using induction, prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n^7-n$ is divisible by 42.

\begin{solution}
  First, we factor $n^7 - n = n(n^6 - 1)$. Since $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$, this means that if we can show that $n^7 - n$ can be both divisible by 2, 3 and 7 then we are also done. We can also show these independently since 2, 3 and 7 are all prime numbers, so they share no factors besides 1. 

  First, let's show that $n^7 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$. This is easy: if $n$ is even, then $n^7 - n$ is clearly even since the difference of two even numbers is even. Further, if $n$ is odd, then $n^7 - n$ is still even since the difference of two odd numbers is also even.

  Now let's show that $n^7 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. Since all residues modulo 3 are either $0, \pm 1$, this means the following: 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ then clearly $n^7 - n$ is divisible. 
    \item If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ then $n^7 - n \equiv 1^7 - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, so this is divisible by 3 as well.
    \item If $n \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$ then $n^7 - n \equiv (-1)^7 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, so this is also divisible by 3.
  \end{itemize}

  Finally, let's analyze the factorization. If $n \equiv 0 \pmod {42}$ then we are done. Now we look at the case where $n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{42}$. From Fermat's little theorem, we know that $n^6 \equiv 1 \pmod {7}$ for all $n \in \{1, 2, \dots, 6\}$. However, we can extend this further to any $n$, since the base of the exponential can always be rewritten as a power of $\{1, 2, \dots, 6\}$ modulo 7. Thus, $n^6 -1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for any $n$, and so this is always divisible by 7.  

  Since this number is always divisible by 2, 3, and 7, then $n^7 - n$ is always divisible by 42 $\forall n \in \mathbb N$.
  % Now we factor $n^6 - 1 = (n^3+1)(n^3-1)$. One of these is a multiple of 7, so let's go through them both. Suppose $n^3 +1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, 
\end{solution}

\Question{Euler's Totient Function} 

  Euler's totient function is defined as follows:
  \[ \phi(n) = \abs{\{i: 1 \leq i \leq n, \gcd(n,i) = 1\}}\]
  In other words, $\phi(n)$ is the total number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to it. We develop a general formula to compute $\phi(n)$.

  \begin{Parts}
    \Part Let $p$ be a prime number. What is $\phi(p)$?

    \begin{solution}
      $\phi(p) = p-1$, since by definition, no number less than $p$ divides $p$.
    \end{solution}

    \Part Let $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be some positive integer. What is $\phi(p^k)$?

    \begin{solution}
      The numbers which are not coprime to $p^k$ will be the multiples of $p$. Since we can write $p^k = p^{k-1} \cdot p$, this means that there are $p^{k-1}$ multiples of $p$ which are less than $p^k$. Thus, $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.
      \end{solution}

    \Part Show that if $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $\phi(mn) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$. (Hint: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.)

    \begin{solution}
      From the chinese remainder theorem, we know that if 

      \begin{align*}
        x &\equiv a \pmod{m}\\
        x &\equiv b \pmod{n} 
      \end{align*}

      Guarantees a unique $c$ which satisfies $x \equiv c \pmod{mn}$. This means that for any $(a, b)$ we choose, there will be a unique value of $c$. Now consider the following: if $x$ is coprime to $m$, then it follows from the Euclidean algorithm that $\gcd(x, m) = \gcd(m, x \pmod m) = 1$ and since $x \equiv a \pmod m$, then this implies that $\gcd(m, a) = 1$. The same argument goes for $x$ and $n$: $\gcd(x, n) = \gcd(n, b) = 1$. In other words, this means that if $x$ is coprime to $m$, then $a$ is also coprime to $m$, and likewise for $b$ and $n$. 

      Now, instead of looking for integers which are coprime to $m$ and $n$, we can now shift our focus to $a$ and $b$ since if $x$ is coprime to $m$ and $n$ this is the same as looking for numbers $a$ and $b$ which are individually coprime to $m$ and $n$ respectively. 

      For $m$, there are $\phi(m)$ numbers coprime to $m$, meaning that there are $\phi(m)$ choices of $a$ we can make. Likewise, there are $\phi(n)$ choices of $b$ that we can make as well. Thus, there are $\phi(m)\phi(n)$ ways of choosing $(a, b)$ such that $x$ is coprime to $m$ and coprime to $n$. 
      
      Finally, notice that if $\gcd(x, m) = \gcd(x, n) = 1$, then it follows that $\gcd(x, mn) = 1$. Had this not been true, then it would mean that $x$ would have shared a factor with either $m$ or $n$ so either $\gcd(x, m) \neq 1$ or $\gcd(x, n) \neq 1$. Thus, becuase this fact is true, then this means that every unique $x$ we found by selecting $(a, b)$ not only corresponds to a unique $x$, but also an $x$ which is coprime to $mn$. Since the number of ways we can do this is $\phi(m)\phi(n)$, this means that $\phi(mn) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$.

      We also need to prove that this list is complete. That is, there doesn't exist an integer $k \in \phi(mn)$ such that it does not appear in $\phi(m)$ or $\phi(n)$. If this is true, then this means that $\gcd(k, m)$ or $\gcd(k, n)$ is not equal to 1, and if this is true then $k$ cannot be coprime to $n$. 

      % And from the notes, we know that if $\gcd(a, m) = 1$ and $\gcd(b, m) = 1$ then $x$ is also coprime to $mn$.
    \end{solution}

    \Part Argue that if the prime factorization of $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$, then
    \[ \phi(n) = n \prod_{i = 1}^k \frac{p_i - 1}{p_i} \]
    
    \begin{solution}
    Firstly, notice that since each prime is coprime to the all other primes, we can write 


    \begin{align*}
      \phi(n) &= \phi(p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}) = \phi(p_1^{\alpha_1})\phi(p_2^{\alpha_2}) \cdots \phi(p_k^{\alpha_k})\\
      &= (p_1^{\alpha_1} - p_1^{\alpha_1 - 1}) \cdots (p_k^{\alpha_k} - p_k^{\alpha_k - 1})
    \end{align*}

integers less than or equal to $n$ which are coprime to $n$ (including 1).

\Question{Sparsity of Primes}

A prime power is a number that can be written as $p^i$ for some prime $p$ and some
positive integer $i$. So, $9 = 3^2$ is a prime power, and so is $8 = 2^3$. $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$ is not
a prime power.

Prove that for any positive integer $k$, there exists $k$ consecutive positive integers
such that none of them are prime powers.

\emph{Hint: This is a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. We want to find $x$ such that $x + 1, x + 2, \ldots, x+k$ are all not powers of primes. We can enforce this by saying that $x+1$ through $x+k$ each must have two distinct prime divisors.}


\begin{solution}
  Apologies in advance because my solution is not the intended one. 
  
  We prove that $k! + 1, k! + 2, \dots, k! + k$ can be chosen as the consecutive positive integers for $k \ge 4$, and we show that consecutive integers also exist for $k < 4$ by example. Let's do the example first, to get it out of the way. If $k = 1$, $15$ is a solution. If $k = 2$, the numbers $15, 16$ are a valid pair. If $k = 3$, then $14, 15, 16$ is a valid triplet. Now we prove this is true for $k \ge 4$. 

  Let's look at the string of $k$ integers again. Notice that for any $a \le k$, we can rewrite the term $k! + a$ in the following way:

  \[k! + a = a\left(\frac{k!}{a} + 1\right)\]

  $k!/a$ is guaranteed to be divisible by $a$, since $a \le k$, so $k!$ contains $a$ as a factor. Now we need to prove that $k! + a$ is not a prime power for any $a < k$. Notice that in order for $k! + a$ to be a prime power, then it follows that $k!/a + 1$ must also be a prime power, since a prime power can only be expressed as a product of two smaller prime powers.\footnote{{\color{blue}{We can prove this is true by noticing that for any $b$ given prime $a$: \[ a^n b = a^m \implies b = \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\] which is clearly a prime power.}}} Now notice that 
  
  \[\frac{k!}{a} + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod {a}\]

  So this term can never be a prime power. And since this works for any $a < k$, none of the integers in $k! + 1, \dots, k! +k$ can be prime powers, so we are done. $\blacksquare$
\end{solution}
