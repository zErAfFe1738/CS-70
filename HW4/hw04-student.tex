\Question{Modular Practice}

Solve the following modular arithmetic equations for $x$ and $y$.
\begin{Parts}
\Part $9x+5 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$.

\Part Show that $3x+15 \equiv 4 \pmod{21}$ does not have a solution.

\Part The system of simultaneous equations
$3x+2y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ and $2x+y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$.

\Part $13^{2019} \equiv x \pmod{12}$.

\Part $7^{21} \equiv x \pmod{11}$.

\end{Parts}

\Question{Nontrivial Modular Solutions}

\begin{Parts}

\Part What are all the possible perfect cubes modulo 7?

\Part Show that any solution to $a^3 + 2b^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ must satisfy $a \equiv b \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.

\Part Using part (b), prove that $a^3 + 2b^3 = 7a^2b$ has no non-trivial solutions $(a, b)$ in the integers. In other words, there are no integers $a$ and $b$, that satisfy this equation, except the trivial solution $a=b=0$.

[\emph{Hint:} Consider some nontrivial solution $(a, b)$ with the smallest value for $\abs{a}$ (why are we allowed to consider this?). Then arrive at a contradiction by finding another solution $(a', b')$ with $\abs{a'} < \abs{a}$.]

\end{Parts}

\Question{Wilson's Theorem}

Wilson's Theorem states the following is true if and only if $p$ is prime:
    \[(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.\]
Prove both directions (it holds if AND only if $p$ is prime).

Hint for the if direction: Consider rearranging the terms in $(p - 1)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot (p - 1)$ to pair up terms with their inverses, when possible. What terms are left unpaired?

Hint for the only if direction: If $p$ is composite, then it has some prime factor $q$.  What can we say about $(p-1)! \pmod{q}$?

\Question{Fermat's Little Theorem}

Without using induction, prove that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n^7-n$ is divisible by 42.

\Question{Euler's Totient Function} 

  Euler's totient function is defined as follows:
  \[ \phi(n) = \abs{\{i: 1 \leq i \leq n, \gcd(n,i) = 1\}}\]
  In other words, $\phi(n)$ is the total number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to it. We develop a general formula to compute $\phi(n)$.

  \begin{Parts}
    \Part Let $p$ be a prime number. What is $\phi(p)$?

    \Part Let $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be some positive integer. What is $\phi(p^k)$?

    \Part Show that if $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $\phi(mn) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$. (Hint: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.)

    \Part Argue that if the prime factorization of $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$, then
    \[ \phi(n) = n \prod_{i = 1}^k \frac{p_i - 1}{p_i}. \]

  \end{Parts}


\pagebreak
\Question{Euler's Totient Theorem}Euler's Totient Theorem states that, if $n$ and $a$ are coprime,
\[
  a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
\]
where $\phi(n)$ (known as Euler's Totient Function) is the number of positive
integers less than or equal to $n$ which are coprime to $n$ (including 1).

\begin{Parts}
  \Part Let the numbers less than $n$ which are coprime to $n$ be $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}$. 
  Argue that the set
  \[\{am_1, am_2, \ldots, am_{\phi(n)}\}\]
  is a permutation of the set
  \[\{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\}.\]
  In other words, prove that 
  \[f:\{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\} \to \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\}\]
  is a bijection, where $f(x) \coloneqq ax \pmod{n}$.

  \Part Prove Euler's Theorem. (Hint: Recall the FLT proof.)

\Question{Sparsity of Primes}

A prime power is a number that can be written as $p^i$ for some prime $p$ and some
positive integer $i$. So, $9 = 3^2$ is a prime power, and so is $8 = 2^3$. $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$ is not
a prime power.

Prove that for any positive integer $k$, there exists $k$ consecutive positive integers
such that none of them are prime powers.

\emph{Hint: This is a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. We want to find $x$ such that $x + 1, x + 2, \ldots, x+k$ are all not powers of primes. We can enforce this by saying that $x+1$ through $x+k$ each must have two distinct prime divisors.}
